Wanderlust Weblog Project
=======

Purpose
-----------
  This is a group project that we developed for our final Coding Dojo project. Our group had a 6 hour time difference between our furthest members and this gave birth to the idea of an app that can connect people around the world. Originally titled "Travel Journal" we wanted to give users a place to upload and share information about different places that they have visited. The application allows uses to register, login, and add/edit information about specific trips that they have taken. Users can store information about the city, country, dates visited, a description of what they did, and their favorite photo from the trip. Users are able to view trips uploaded by other users on the community page that may spark their own wanderlust!

 We hope that you enjoy traveling with us!
