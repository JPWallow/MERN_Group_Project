MERN Group Project Proposal 

Working Title: Travel Journal 

Stack: MERN

Project Description: 
    During our first meeting we discussed how excited we were to collaborate on a project even though there is a 6 hour time zone difference between 
    members of the group. This led to the decision for both our group name and our project concept. We quickly decided that we would want to create 
    an application that can connect people no matter the distance. This led to our decision to make a travel journal application.
    
    We want to create an application that allows users to login to a dashboard displaying a table of trips that they have experienced. 
    The users will be able to upload information about the trip including location, dates, comments, and the ability to upload their favorite 
    photo from the trip. On the destination detail page we would like to access a Weather API to display the historic weather data for the trip 
    location in addition to the user generated form data. The final page of the application will be a community page which allows users to see 
    trips that other users have experienced. 

MVP:
    -Login and Registration with validations (name length requirements, valid email, password length, matching passwords) 
    -Nav bar component
    -Dashboard page user's name and user specific trip information
    -Dashboard links for details, edit, and delete.
    -Create destination page with validations for all fields provided, redirect to dashboard on successful submit.
    -Edit destination page with validations for all fields provided, redirect to dashboard on successful submit.
    -Image upload capabilities on create and edit pages.
    -Detail page displaying all data for a single trip. 
    -Weather API integration on trip detail page.
    -Community page displaying all trips data in database.

Stretch Goals/ Backlog:
    -Weather for the entire trip, not just one date.
    -Comments on Community Page (Many to Many Relationship)
    -Integration of an Airport API

    Edward Griffin: Login/Registration (Front-End and Back-End)/ Weather API
    Renee Ishikawa: Back-End/ Weather API
    Dieu Ha: Wireframe Design/CSS
